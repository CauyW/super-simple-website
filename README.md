# Testing My Progess

### Languages Used :

Html &nbsp;|&nbsp; CSS &nbsp;|&nbsp; JavaScript
<br>

#

It is just a small amount of code within a single html file I put together displaying a simple action of pressing a button to change the inner text, backgound color, and color of the text. Through use of GitHub pages I managed to put it as a url <a href="https://cauyw.github.io/super-simple-website/" target="_blank">here</a>.

### How They Were Used :

Html &nbsp;|&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>Basic structure of the file within the head and body elements.</li>
  <li>Used &ltstyle&gt instead of a separate CSS file to format the page.</li>
  <li>Used &ltscript&gt instead of a separate Js file to give functions to the buttons</li>
</ul>

CSS &nbsp;|&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>Within the &ltstyle&gt element it allowed the centering of the page and its contents.</li>
  <li>Used to alter the colors and text within the prompt.</li>
</ul>

JavaScript &nbsp;|&nbsp;

<ul>
  <li>Within the &ltscript&gt element it created functions with if statements to enable the CSS elements when given the proper response.</li>
  <li>Made use of document.getElementById() within a function to make changes and receive responses from elements with certain IDs.</li>
</ul>
